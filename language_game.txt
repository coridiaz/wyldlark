Welcome to _____
You find yourself in the middle of a vast forest clearing. 
All around are towering Oak Trees and mist.

You carry a backpack containing *some things?* and a battered leather spellbook.

*user action*
[open | read] [spellbook | book]

List out spells 
[fire] - creates flame
[water] - creates stream of water
[earth] - grows living things

*user action*
[close] [spellbook | book]

The mist crawls towards the treeline, revealing a single sprout in the center of the clearing.

*user action*
[cast] [earth] at [sprout]

The sprout shoots farther and farther out of the earth. It grows limbs that twist on itself and become gnarled. 
In place of the sprout a weathered old tree now stands. 
At the base of the tree is a wooden door with a small stained glass window. A dim light glows behind it.  

*user action*
[open] [door] | [knock] on [door] -> *no one answers*

The door swings open to a round room...
