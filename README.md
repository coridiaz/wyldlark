# Wyldlark

Wyldlark is a text adventure game made using the language Wyldlark.
This language parses a sub section of English text using a Lark style grammar. 
The user can type anything in to the terminal, if the structure is recognized by the parser, a gameplay action will print, otherwise a message to the effect of "nothing happens" will print instead. 

In Wyldlark the user can interact with objects, cast spells, and add or drop things from an inventory.
Wyldlark typically takes sentences of the following form respective of their use case, with optional articles and punctuation:
<verb> <object/item>
<cast> <spellname> <object>
<add/drop> <item>

<help> will print the user some common use cases/actions.

To run Wyldlark install the requirements and run the main.py file from the terminal.
You are invited to play through the game however a cheat.txt file is included with suggested inputs to navigate from the beginning to end for testing purposes or in case you get stuck. Simply use this as a guide or copy and paste in the input prompt while running main.py
